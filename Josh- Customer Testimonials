<font size = "2"> <font color = "Black"> The cooking cabin was able to provide me everything I need to prepare my family some delicious homemade meals! Christie and Chris was more than willing to help educate me on everything I needed, and even offered me a discount on their class where they taught me proper maintenance of my new appliances! I would highly recommend their services to anyone looking to expand their culinary capabilities! </font> </font>
