<font size = "3"> <font color = "White"> The cooking cabin was able to provide me everything I need to prepare my family some delicious homemade meals! Christie and Chris was more than willing to help educate me on everything I needed, and even offered me a discount on their class where they taught me proper maintenance of my new appliances! I would highly recommend their services to anyone looking to expand their culinary capabilities! </font> </font>

Easy to use and clean properly, and affordable too! While you're at it, check out my restaurant <a href = "http://www.goatpublafayette.com/" target = "_blank"> here!  </font> </font>
